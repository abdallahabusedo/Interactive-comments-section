- [ ] delete the message "it will be better if i started it with firebase post request to add new id for each record but becouse i used json server i was hrad to manage deleting it but is would be easy if i send a delete request with the parentId and the replyId and delete it from the backend"
- [ ] calculating the time of the message for example "1 day ago" it can be done by receving the createdAt date from the backend and calculate the deffrance between the createdAt and the current date
